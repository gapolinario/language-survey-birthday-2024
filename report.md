# Birthday Party Statistics

Gabriel Apolin√°rio, February 25, 2024

For my birthday this year, I had a celebration and did an informal survey with my friends on they languages they speak. Everyone was asked
1. Which languages they speak
2. And to rank them in order of skill
And here are the results of the survey.

Let's start with first languages, with Spanish and German being the most popular.

| Language | L1 speakers |
|--|--|
| Spanish     |  6 |
| German      |  5 |
| English     |  3 |
| Portuguese  |  3 |
| Arabic      |  2 |
| Italian     |  2 |
| Serbian     |  1 |

Then, notice that English is the second language of almost everyone.

| Language | L2 speakers |
|--|--|
| English  |  16 |
| German   |   3 |
| French   |   1 |
| Hindi    |   1 |
| Swahili  |   1 |

And German the most common third language.

| Language | L3 speakers |
|--|--|
| German     | 10 |
| English    |  3 |
| Spanish    |  3 |
| French     |  2 |
| Latin      |  1 |
| Romanian   |  1 |
| Swedish    |  1 |

In the next table, we see a histogram of the number of languages spoken by everyone. For instance, 9 persons speak 3 languages.

| Languages | Persons |
|--|--|
| 2   |  1   |
| 3   |  9   |
| 4   |  5   |
| 5   |  4   |
| 6   |  1   |
| 9   |  2   |

With this table one can compute some basic statistical observables related to the number of languages spoken:

Mean: 4.2
Mode: 3.0
Median: 4.0
Standard deviation: 1.8

Next, a list of all languages, and how many speakers of each of them, at any level.

| Language | Number of speakers |
|--|--|
| English  |  22 |
| German  |  22 |
| Spanish  |  13 |
| French  |  10 |
| Italian  |  5 |
| Portuguese  |  5 |
| Arabic  |  4 |
| Latin  |  3 |
| Ancient Greek  |  1 |
| Greek  |  1 |
| Hindi  |  1 |
| Marathi  |  1 |
| Romanian  |  1 |
| Serbian  |  1 |
| Swahili  |  1 |
| Swedish  |  1 |
| Wolof  |  1 |

As a last observable, I'm looking for a language that predicts multilingualism. The following numbers represent: For instance, consider French. What is the probability that a person speaks four or more languages, given that they speak French? This probability is 90%, as the table shows.

| Language | Probability to speak 4+ languages |
|--|--|
|Italian |100% |
|Latin |100%  |
|French |90% |
|Portuguese |80% |
|Arabic |75% |
|Spanish |62% |
|English |55% |
|German |55% |
