# Birthday Party Statistics

Gabriel Apolin√°rio, February 25, 2024

For my birthday this year, I had a celebration and did an informal survey with my friends on the languages they speak. Everyone was asked

1. Which languages they speak
2. And to rank them in order of skill

There were 22 participants, hence very small statistics. Here are the results of the survey.

Let's start with first languages, with Spanish and German being the most popular.

| Language | L1 speakers |
|--|--|
| Spanish     |  6 |
| German      |  5 |
| English     |  3 |
| Portuguese  |  3 |
| Arabic      |  2 |
| Italian     |  2 |
| Serbian     |  1 |

Then, notice that English is the second language of almost all participants.

| Language | L2 speakers |
|--|--|
| English  |  16 |
| German   |   3 |
| French   |   1 |
| Hindi    |   1 |
| Swahili  |   1 |

And German the most common third language.

| Language | L3 speakers |
|--|--|
| German     | 10 |
| English    |  3 |
| Spanish    |  3 |
| French     |  2 |
| Latin      |  1 |
| Romanian   |  1 |
| Swedish    |  1 |

In the next table, we see a histogram of the number of languages spoken by everyone. For instance, 9 persons speak 3 languages.

| Number of Languages | Frequency |
|--|--|
| 2   |  1   |
| 3   |  9   |
| 4   |  5   |
| 5   |  4   |
| 6   |  1   |
| 9   |  2   |

With this table one can compute some basic statistical observables related to the number of languages spoken:

| Observable | Value |
| -- | -- |
| Mean | 4.2 |
| Mode | 3.0 |
| Median | 4.0 |
| Standard deviation | 1.8 |

Next, a list of all languages mentioned, and the number of speakers of each of them, at any level.

| Language | Number of speakers |
|--|--|
| English  |  22 |
| German  |  22 |
| Spanish  |  13 |
| French  |  10 |
| Italian  |  5 |
| Portuguese  |  5 |
| Arabic  |  4 |
| Latin  |  3 |
| Ancient Greek  |  1 |
| Greek  |  1 |
| Hindi  |  1 |
| Marathi  |  1 |
| Romanian  |  1 |
| Serbian  |  1 |
| Swahili  |  1 |
| Swedish  |  1 |
| Wolof  |  1 |

As a last observable, I'm looking for a predictor of multilingualism. Look at French in the table, for instance. The following number represents: What is the probability that a person in this group speaks four or more languages, given that they speak French? This probability is 90%, as the table shows. Only languages spoken by more than one person were considered for this statistic.

| Language | Probability of speaking 4+ languages |
|--|--|
|Italian |100% |
|Latin |100%  |
|French |90% |
|Portuguese |80% |
|Arabic |75% |
|Spanish |62% |
|English |55% |
|German |55% |

Thank you to all participants for joining, and remember to do statistics responsibly. This sample is very small, and doesn't represent any overarching trends.
